        <p class = "w3-padding w3-half">Before the incoming of traditional computers, there were some mechanical machines 
            used to execute simple calculations. 
            One of the most famous machines is the Jacquar loom, which  was able to create special designs in the clothes by 
            reading a hole-punched cardboard.
            With the Electronic Age, vacuum tubes replaced the mechanical parts, thus allowing machines to make more calculations 
            of various types. To set the type of the calculation they needed to regolate vacuum tubes with a welder.
            The first programmable electronic computer was Mark-1 Colossus, by Alan Turing. It was born to help British Army for 
            decoding German codes in WII.
            Due to the secrecy of that project, the very first Programmable electronic computer was the ENIAC Computer. To imagine 
            the greatness of this machine, just think that it was composed by five million hand-soldered connections and it was bigger 
            than a room. One of the most important partecipants of this project was John Von Neumann. 
            After WWII mainframes like ENIAC kept spreading all over the world and being  increasingly powerful, thanks to the invention 
            of transistors.
            Nowadays lots of companies use mainframes for specific purposes.

        	From the end of 1960s, people made attempts to make computer extremely widespread to solve the problems of cost and size. 
            In 1957 Olivetti, stimulated by Enrico Fermi, launched Eula 9300, one of the earliest ancestors of the modern computers. 
            In 1970s Packard introduced new computers programmed with basic language, equipped with a small display, keybord and a printer. 
            The real impulse for the proliferation of personal computer occurred thanks to the possibility of including several microprocessors 
            in single integrated circuits. 
            In 1981 was relased the first personal computer, he IBM 5150, known as IBM pc.
            It was expansive, had low power and needed expansive hard drives, but it was solid, reliable and expandible.
            IBM pc became the standard machine in the personal computer industry.
            On 24 January 1984, Apple introduced Macintosh. This computer was equipped with a set of grapical interfaces and a mouse.
            It was a business success, especially as to its operating system, MacOS, and the graphical user interface easily understandable.
            Later many of these feautures were "borrowed" by Microsoft in the creation of its Windows operating system. Moreover there was 
            the spreading of the concept of "WIMP"(Windows, Icones, Menus and Pointer) that is now a standard of all interfaces.

            In 70s the new personal computers couldn&#146;t be brought with ease. <br>
            So, notebooks are one of the most important inventions of the ICT world.<br>
            The first portable computer made was the IBM 5100 and it was released in
             1975. It weighted 25 kg.<br>
            After the IBM 5100 lighter and lighter portable computers were made, but
             it was difficult to go below 10 kg, because of the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitor.<br>
            Few years later low-energy consumption and small-sized mass memories were invented.<br>
             The CRT monitors were substituted by light TFT (Thin Film Transistor) thanks
            to the invention of the transistors.<br>
            Finally, the first notebook was made: it was small-sized, 
            slightly power-reduced and suitable for surfing, sending e-mails
            and word processing. Nowadays the are being replaced by tablets.<br>
            Notebooks are composed by two hardware elements of similar size 
            connected together. Furthermore, it can be &#147;closed&#148; by superimposing the two blocks, 
            so the notebook can be carried easily.<br>
            Notebook&#146;s first costs were very high, because of the cost of producing 
            TFT monitors. The cheapest were made with a monochrome screen. Nowadays 
            there are no difference between desktop and notebook costs.

            	In the '80s, as PCs' evolution proceeded, the first<br> hand-held devices made their first apperarence.
                They<br> were called "PDAs", which stands for "Personal<br> Digital Assistant".<br> Theese devices were useful for
                managing contacts<br> and commitments, but they had more features like<br> the calculator, too.
                In few word, they were real<br> computers, which could stand in the palm of your<br> hand.<br>
                Over the years, PDAs were improved, so they were<br> able to syncronize your contacts and calendar,by<br> linking
                them with a cable to a PC, using infrared or<br> Bluetooth or even browsing the net. Moreover, their<br> hardware implementations 
                (like better touchscreens or improved<br> CPUs) were fundamental and so<br> significative.<br>
                While the PDAs were furthermore evolving, in the<br> 90s, another important device was evolving: the<br> mobile phone.<br>
                Theese devices were getting a lot of new features, the same that<br>PDAs had before. This parallel evolution brought to 
                the birth of a<br>new, powerful device: the smartphone.<br>
                Smartphones included all the PDAs features,<br> but they had the possibility to make calls. This<br> technological evolution will mark
                the end of hand-<br>held computers.<br>
                In the new millennia the tactile display technology (Touchscreen)<br>has been implemented in other devices too, like notebooks<br> or
                desktop PCs. Notebooks got more compact, and<br> with their comfortable touchscreens a new device was introduced,<br> the tablet.
                There are a lot of type of<br> tablets, from the PCs-looking-like (for their hardware and <br>powerfulness) to "big-smartphones" 
                (also known as<br> second-generation-tablets).<br>
                Theese devices are evolving in different manners, and they are<br> starting to take the place of laptops because of their
                compact and<br> light design, in fact in the last years some tablet<br> manufacturers equippd their products with thin keyboards,<br> 
                which can be directly attached to the device,<br> making it look like a proper laptop.<br>
                The main feature that differentiates tablets and PCs<br> is the possibility to connect to the internet via cellular line<br> without
                external devices.</div>
